#### A few GitHub rules:
- Keep file paths short and sensible.
- Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
- Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.

Ettiquette mark down file could be used to specify the rules or the way in which a particular file or program should be done.
